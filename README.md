## Managing Projects

- Everything starts with an issue
  - could be a story
  - a task
  - a bug
- Project boards can be used to track sprints
  - they can live in repos, orgs, and user namespases
- GitHub's take on issues are lightweight
  - They may not work well for things like measuring velocity or burndown charts
  - They don't have story points or time estimates

### Best practices for code collab

- always start with an issue
- start a feature branch to work off of
- include the issue number in the commit message
- mention the issue number in the PR
